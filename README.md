Flight Cancellations Visualization


This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. The focus of this project is on flight cancellation numbers regarding airlines and airport involving most frequent cancellations. 
The project also shows the frequency of cancellations caused by different reasons in relation with month and day of week.
